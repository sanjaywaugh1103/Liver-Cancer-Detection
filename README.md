# Liver Cancer Detection Using Image Processing

This project implements a liver cancer detection system using image processing techniques in Python, 
leveraging the capabilities of Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Preprocessing of medical images.
- Image segmentation and feature extraction.
- Machine learning model for cancer detection.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later.
- Jupyter Notebook.
- Required Python libraries:

```
numpy==1.23.0
pandas==1.5.3
matplotlib==3.6.2
scikit-learn==1.2.0
opencv-python==4.7.0.68
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd liver-cancer-detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `liver cancer detection using image processing.ipynb`.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to process data and perform cancer detection.
